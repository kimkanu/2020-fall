Response Paper 3 (Week 4)

1. Is marriage based on a sexual bond or social bond? Do these two different kinds of bonds coincide in marriage or not? What do you think, and which do you think is more important? (No in-between answers, please - you have to choose one side.)

Two kinds of bonds may not coincide even in marriage. In addition, while a sexual bond might be a part of the marriage, I think the social pair bond is more important to start and maintain the marriage.

1-1. On the handout, which theories emphasize biological factors over social factors? Considering your answer to Q1, which theory sounds most persuasive? 

Evolutionary psychology, ideal mate theory, free-choice mate selection;
I think the social exchange theory is quite persuasive to me.

2. Divorced people face sometimes difficult situations or questions because of social stereotypes or prejudice. Why do some people consider increasing divorce rates as a problem? And how does a divorced status affect men and women in a different way? Could this be different in a matrilineal society?

Some people insists increasing divorce rates could be a problem in the following viewpoints:
- It may break apart a family or make family members go into depression and this results in a unhealthier society
- It may affect the economy of the entire society in a bad way

In a patriarchal society, there are many examples of the gender gap of divorced people and it hits women harder. For instance, divorce affects women's finances with a bigger hit: womenâ€™s household income falls 41% after a divorce, as a research done by US Government Accountability Office on 2012 insist; and even women's credit scores dropped more rapidly than men's, 54% vs. 42%, according to an online survey by the credit reporting bureau Experian.

3. How do you draw a boundary among your relatives, and how do you categorize them? Who are you closest to? Share with your discussion group the way you categorize your kinship group, and discuss how important biological relations are in drawing the boundary of kinship. Further, discuss whether "consanguinity" or biological connection is essential in establishing kinship relations - based on your experience in your own culture and based on what you have learned in this course.

I'd lived with my maternal family members for a quite long time, so I am familiar with them than paternal people. For the first time, the kinship at the birth could be affected by biological relations, but biological connection may not be necessary for the kinships which is not the case, and the time lived with them becomes more important.
