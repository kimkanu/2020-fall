1. Please mark your own position on each spectrum on the handout "The Genderbread Person." Why do you think there can be a difference between positions marked on the two spectra (spectrums) of gender identity and gender expression?

It is because that the interpretation of genders may differ from person to person, or from culture to culture. For example, a woman may behave more masculinely--in the traditional manner-- than other people, while identifying her as a female.


2. Why do we need the term “gender”? Think about situations in your everyday life where the term “sex” is not enough to describe different qualities of people. Please prepare to share these situations with your discussion group.

There is no reason to live following the gender role associated with the birth sex, and there are some people who don't follow those gender roles given at birth. For instance, a person who don't think themselves as either masculine or feminine could identify themselves as an agender person.


3. Based on the reading material, how and why did Dubois get interested in gender issues? How is his approach and perspective different from de Beauvoir’s? (It will be helpful to try and find explanations about the reading material in the online lectures.)

Du Bois had approached to the gender issues from the black rights acts. He said, in the article "The Damnation of Women" written by him, that the pressure to have beauty was only given to women, and he pointed out that the 'beauty' at that time did not go for black women, especially. Instead, black women are expected to be strong in order to do works well.

De Beauvoir saw these issues from another point: women were always the 'Other', opposed to the 'One', the male. She compared the situations women are suffering from with ones of Jews or black people, and found that there was a deep similarity in rationalizing the discrimination by proving the inferiority of the corresponding group.
