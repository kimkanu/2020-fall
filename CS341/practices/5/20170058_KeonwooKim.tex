        Using 2.4 GHz networks, the throughput varies over the distance between A and B.
        \item[1.3.1.] Using \texttt{WIFI\_PHY\_STANDARD\_80211\_10MHZ}, there are (almost) no decrease in the throughput, while \texttt{WIFI\_PHY\_STANDARD\_80211g} shows a decrease in the throughput. Thus, 5 GHz communication is more robust to interferences.
        \item[1.3.2.] \texttt{WIFI\_PHY\_STANDARD\_80211\_10MHZ} is for 5 GHz networking, while \texttt{WIFI\_PHY\_STANDARD\_80211g} is for 2.4 GHz networking.
        \item[1.4.] When the position of Node C is moved to $(-1000000, 0, 0)$, far enough from A and B, the throughput is close to 3.05909 Mbps, which is the maximum rate. So, we can guess that the role of Node C is to give an interference to the communication.

        \item[2.5.] The right one is for 2.5.1. and the left one is for 2.5.2.

        \item[2.5.3.] In general, the experiment with RTS/CTS enabled shows higher throughputs than one with RTS/CTS disabled. Since RTS/CTS is used to reduce frame collisions due to hidden node problems, it will reduce frame collisions and the throughput will increase.
